# Task Manager - Candidate Technical Challenge

## Overview
This is a boilerplate setup for a Task Management application using ReactJS and TypeScript. The purpose of this project is to evaluate candidates' knowledge and skills in ReactJS by asking them to implement additional features and improvements.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone to your local machine
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

## Tasks

Below is a list of additional features and improvements categorized by difficulty level. Candidates are encouraged to implement as many of these as possible to showcase their skills.

A high level explanation of each task is listed below. These explanations are deliberately light on detail to allow you the opportunity to showcase your skillset and your ability to interpret instruction.

1. **Basic Styling Enhancements:** APAS uses AntDesign Ensure the application is responsive across different screen sizes.
2. **Task Filtering:** Implement a simple filter functionality to allow users to filter tasks based on their names or descriptions.
3. **Task Completion Toggle:** Add a checkbox or toggle button to mark tasks as completed or incomplete, with completed tasks displayed differently (e.g., strikethrough text).
4. **Form Validation:** Implement comprehensive form validation using a library like Formik or React Hook Form. Display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.
5. **Local Storage Persistence:** Store tasks in the browser's local storage to persist tasks across page reloads.
6. **Task Prioritization:** Add a priority field (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to tasks and allow users to sort tasks based on priority.
7. **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for components using a testing library like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the application functions correctly.
8. **API Integration:** Replace the mock API with a real backend service (e.g., using Express.js and a database like MongoDB) and handle asynchronous data fetching with error handling.
9. **State Management:** Integrate a state management solution like Redux or MobX for better state handling, especially as the application scales.
10. **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication (e.g., using JWT) to allow multiple users to manage their own tasks. Secure the application and ensure only authenticated users can access their tasks.
11. **Boilerplate Improvements:** This boilerplate has been created using ChatGPT, a tool we typically don't use in our development lifecycle. The boilerplate project is below our standard and needs to be improved. You're encouraged to identify and fix any issues with the boilerplate. In your commit message explain what the issue was and the impact of the improvement.
